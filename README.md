## Features
Hubby's primary feature allows a designer to create a deal with a client. This deal has different states that change through interactions between the two users (designer and client). 

The client can accept or reject a deal, and the designer can start, complete, and generate an invoice for it. 
Deals are visible within their respective dashboards, where users can interact with them.

Hubby also offers some secondary features:

- Clients can post job offers (to which designers can respond directly).
- Designers can upload their projects.
- Both clients and designers can view projects, a list of clients, and a list of designers.
